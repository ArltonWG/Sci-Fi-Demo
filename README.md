# Sci-Fi-Demo
Basic 3D game done with a Udemy Course

Environment was provided but all code was done with the course and adapted slightly. 
This is my first exposure to 3d Game Development so it is very short and more about getting used to the features.

Unity Source Code too large to commit. Can share this on request
