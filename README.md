# Sci-Fi-Demo
Basic 3D game done with a Udemy Course

Environment was provided but all code was done with the course and adapted slightly. 
This is my first exposure to 3d Game Devlopment so it is very short and more about getting used to the features.
Unzip the File provided and play straight from the exe file.
